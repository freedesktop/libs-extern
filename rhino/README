The Scripting Framework makes use of the Rhino (http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/)
JavaScript interpreter, available under the Mozilla Public License 
(http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html).

In addition, to support the debugging of scripts contained in OpenOffice.org
documents, we have modified the Java source file Main.java.

The modified source code is rebuilt and repackaged in the Rhino js.jar file
before being deliver to the OpenOffice.org solver. The modified source is
also available from the OpenOffice.org website at:

http://framework.openoffice.org/source/browse/framework/scripting/examples/java/debugger/rhino/Main.java

In order to allow Java classloading to work properly (issue 30929)
we have included versions of a number of files from Rhino 1.5R4.1
