The Scripting Framework makes use of the Rhino (http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/)
JavaScript interpreter, available under the Mozilla Public License 
(http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html).

In addition, to support the debugging of scripts contained in OpenOffice.org
documents, we have modified the Java source file Main.java.

The Rhino source tarball is patched with the modified code. The Rhino
Jar file (js.jar) is then built and delivered to the solver. The file
rhino15R4.patch contains the changes made in order to build Rhino. The
patch was generated using the command: diff -wurN
