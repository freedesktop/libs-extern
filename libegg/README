This is a fragment of libegg - an experimental library of code for cut/paste into
various applications. The canonical version can be found at:
http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/libegg/

however - this functionality is included in (newer) gtk+ versions in the core
toolkit, so eventually this module will be deprecated and die in favour of
that code.
